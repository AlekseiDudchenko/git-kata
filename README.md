# Git Kata

## quickfix

This is a common situation: you are working on something and you need to make a quick fix.
You need to add something new to the file but you want to preserve your current work and commit it later.

Execute `kata.sh` script and:
 * add title to the file ('My favorite colors') and commit this change
 * add final color to your list and commit it

 Hint: try to do this kata in two ways, using `git add -p` and `git stash`.
